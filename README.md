This is the second HTML file that i do. It's an exercise developed by Odin project. I hope to work a little more than my first HTML and also to explore more CSS. 

Ok, there is a lot of trouble positioning things, need to learn more about alignement, display and position properties. I could made somehow a snapshot that looks like google, but when minimizing it, everything becomes bad.

Well, was the second job trying to do something with HTML and CSS. A lot to improve yet, but i think it was alright to learn a bit of CSS and test some HTML elements.
